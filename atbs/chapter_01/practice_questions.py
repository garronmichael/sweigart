5. An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a single value while a statement is an instruction that can be
    executed.

6. 20

7. 'spamspamspam'

8. 100 is not a valid variable name because a valid variable name cannot start with a number. eggs is a valid varialble
    name because it begins with a letter, contains only letters, numbers and underscores, does not contain space and
    is not a python keyword.

9. str(), int(), float()

10. 'I eat ' + 99 + ' burritos.' causes an error because python does not have implicit type coercion. This is fixed by
    explicit type coercion: 'I eat ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
