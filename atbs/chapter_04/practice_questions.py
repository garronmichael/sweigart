# 1. Functions are helpful because they can deduplicate repetitive executions, abstract away inner workings to focus on
#   inputs and outputs, restrict the scope of variables

# 2. Code in a function is executed when it is called

# 3. The def statement creates a function

# 4. A function is a function definition while a function call is when the function is executed

# 5. There is one global scope in Python. There is no limit to the number of local scopes in Python.

# 6. Variables in a local scope are removed after the function call returns

# 7. A return value is the output of a function. A return value can be part of an expression.

# 8. Functions will return None if no other return value is defined

# 9. Functions can be forced to reference a global variable with a global statement. Ex: global spam

# 10. None has a datatype of NoneType and is the only member

# 11. Imports the module areallyourpetsnamederic

# 12. spam.bacon()

# 13. A try/except block can prevent a program from crashing when an error is thrown

# 14. The try clause will hold the part of the program that may error. The except clause will hold the part of the
#   program that should execution when the error is thrown.

# 15. Each function returns the same number because the return value of the randint function was stored only once to
# a global variable and that same variable is referenced in all six functions.
