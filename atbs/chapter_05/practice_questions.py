# 7. logging.disable()

# 8. Logging messages is better than using print() because a developer can easily disable logging while print()
#   statements must be removed

# 9. Step Over = execute the current line and go to the next line in the program
#   Step In = if the current line is a function call, go to the first line of the function code
#   Step Out = if the current line is within a function call, execute the rest of the function and go to the next line
#   after the function call ends

# 10. Continue/Resume = continue execution until the next breakpoint

# 11. A specified line in the program where the debugger will pause execution

# 12. In pycharm you set a breakpoint by clicking on the left gutter of the line numbers or using the hotkeys/action
# shortcuts
